    <h1 style="color:orange;background-color:black;">What is Computer Science Engineering?</h1>
    <p style="color:darkorchid;">There’s no clear cut computer engineering description or definition because there are a variety of tasks and functions computer engineers perform depending on their industry and where they work.<br><br>

        The simple answer is computer engineering combines computer science with electronic engineering, which allows engineers to create hardware that works with computer networks. To get a clearer picture of what computer engineering consists of, a better question might be, what do computer engineers do exactly?<br><br>
        
        Computer engineers design, create, and test computer hardware and software, analyze the results, and update outdated equipment so that it’s ready to use with new software. Some engineers also oversee manufacturing and development processes, while others are more involved in testing software.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 style="color:orange;background-color:black;">Why is Computer Engineering Important?</h2>
        <p style="color:darkorchid;">Can you imagine a world without your smart phone? What about your laptop, fitbit, or video games? Using these devices has become a major part of our day-to-day lives and routines. As our need for the latest gadgets and technology increases, so does the demand for these professionals. But the labors of computer engineers aren’t just solutions for killing time. Computer engineers interested in data integrity and protection help create data management systems, those interested in working for the military design embedded devices or supercomputers that create war simulations. There are also plenty of use cases in healthcare, including CAT scans, wearable devices, and robotics.<br><br>

            An engineer can be useful in almost any industry since their main function is helping things run efficiently, troubleshooting issues, and of course, problem solving.</p>
            <h3 style="color:orange;background-color:black;">What is the Future of Computer Engineering?</h3>
            <p style="color:darkorchid;">The field of computer hardware engineering is expected to increase 2 percent between 2019 to 2029 as of May 2019 according to the BLS. The demand for computer engineers has increased because of the work they do and their technical skills – designing and optimizing memory devices, networks, and circuit boards. The BLS claims there is more innovation in software development than hardware. However, computer programming jobs are expected to decline 9 percent between 2019 to 2029 as of May 2019.<br><br>

                There are some key differences between computer engineering and computer science, but you’ll find overlap in many online masters in computer engineering programs, which offer courses in both disciplines, treating computer engineering with a more holistic approach. Computer engineers may be seen as more valuable since they can create innovative solutions to fix both hardware and software issues. It may be useful for computer engineers to consider higher education to gain a more competitive edge and are able to apply for jobs that are not limited to hardware.</p>
